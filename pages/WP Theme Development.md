# Lesson 01: Getting started with WP theme development
	- 1) Create a database with an appropriate name
	- 2) Create a folder in xampp/htdocs folder and then copy the extracted wordpress files in that folder.
	- 3) Install wordpress by opening the file using localhost (localhost:8080/(folder name)/wp-admin)
	- 4) Go to the file location where you installed wordpress.
	- 5) Open wp-content folder
	- 6) Open themes folder and then create a folder inside the themes folder by giving an appropriate name.
		- The folder you created will be your theme.
	- 7) After creating the folder, create a style.css file and then open that file in a text editor and comment the theme details such as;
		- Theme Name
		- Theme URI (Uniform Resource Identifier is like link)
		- Author
		- Description
	- 8) After that create a index.php file and then create header.php and footer.php files
	- By default, wordpress won't display the contents of the header and the footer files. to display the content of the header and the footer files you should tell the index.php file to include those files. to do that you should add these code lines in the index.php file
		- To add the footer we should add this code line in the beginning of the file.
			- **<?php get_header();?>** (you can use the file name that you have given to your header file. (get_(fileName))
		- To add the footer we should add this code line after including all the context that needed to be entered. this should be added at the bottom of the file.
			- **<?php get_footer();?>** (<?php get_(footer file name);?>)
	- ## Default files to create at the beginning
		- style.css
		- index.php
		- header.php
		- footer.php
	- To add the styling we should create a separate file to include the styles. in my case I've created a folder name css and then I have created a css file with the theme name. you could use any name you want.
	- To add the JavaScript functions, I have done the same thing.
	- By default wordpress don't include the styles to your theme. we should instruct wordpress to include the style file to our theme.
	- to do that we should create the **functions.php** file.
		- **Don't change the name of the file**
	- ### Always use unique names for your functions
- # Lesson 02: Connecting stylesheets and scripts
	- ## functions.php
		- This file is used to to tell WordPress to connect the custom styling files to the theme.
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1698032297664_0.png)
		- This function is used to specifically enqueue the styles for your WordPress theme.
			- **Enqueue** refers to the system used to manage and add styles to a web page in a proper order.
			- Enqueue is important because later on when we are adding external plugins to the theme, those plugins might want to add their own scripts. if those styles were added in a messy way, there might be conflicts in the scripts. scripts might run before their dependencies or styles might override each other in an unpredictable way.
			- The Enqueue system ensures that everything is loaded in a right order and only once.
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1698205542076_0.png)
			- This action is used to call the function to execute.
				- The 'wp_enqueue_scripts' is what tell wordpress to include all the scripts to the theme.
				- Because it is an action, we code it between single quotes and represent it as a string.
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1698205730759_0.png)
			- The second parameter is the name of the function that the action should execute.
			- This also should be in single quotes.
		- The last 2 parameters aren't needed. we can just erase them.
		- Even though all the php syntaxes are correct, we should specify WordPress to print all the styles.
		- To do that we should use a premade function inside the header of the header.php file.
		- **<?php wp_head(); ?>**
			- This function connects all the WordPress hooks and functions.
		- After embedding the style sheets, we should embed the JavaScript files as well. to do that we should use a function in the footer section.
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1698229327624_0.png)
		- As we did to include the stylesheets, we should give instructions on which js files should be included and where the js scripts should be included. in this case we have added in the footer.
		- After doing this we should open the footer.php and add the code line;
			- **<?php wp_footer(); ?>**
				- This code line will include and execute the functions that are necessary to run the js scripts.
- # Lesson 03: Creating a custom menu and displaying specific pages on specific sections
	- First we should go to the pages section in the WordPress dashboard and create some pages.
	- By default when we click on appearance there is a sub  menu called **Menu** to add and customize our menues.
	- In our case it is not yet added to our theme.
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1698230584933_0.png)
		- If we want to activate a specific theme support when we are creating a theme, it's better to include this hook in a function.
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1698230783639_0.png)
			- In here we could state to execute the function after initialization. which is recommended in most cases.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1698232850778_0.png)
			- We use the **init** method because later on we're going to add more functions and more hooks.
			- To execute after the initialization first we should include **'init'** instead of **'after_setup_theme'**.
	- After following these steps, if we reload the wp dashboard, we could see the menu sub menu under appearances.
	- Now, create the menu with the necessary navigation links
	- After that all we have to do is display the navigation menu in the header.
	- To do that we have to add this code line in the header.php file which will instruct wordpress to display the menu that we created.
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1698281140065_0.png)
	- To display a specific menu, we have to provide the theme location in the parameters. it is done as follows;
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1698281253110_0.png)
		- The theme location, in this case it's **primary** should be the exact name that we have given in the functions.php file.
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1698281334282_0.png)
	- we could create multiple navigations by duplicating the **register_nav_menu** code line.
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1698281497807_0.png)
		- In here we have created another menu called **secondary** and as the description we have stated it as the footer navigation.
		- To display this navigation on our theme we should instruct wordpress to display the menu as we did with the primary menu.
		- To do that we should include this code line in the footer.php file because this menu was intended to be displayed in the footer.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1698282262857_0.png)
		- Now, all we have to is to go to the wp dashboard, under menus, create a new menu and select the footer navigation and select the pages that you intend to display in that menu and save it.
- # Lesson 04: Using Post Loop and custom body class
	- We are done with the header navigation and the footer navigation. now we have to do is include content to our body section.
	- The content in the body section is included in the index.php file.
	- Before adding posts to the body section, we should create the posts using the wp dashboard  Posts tab. after creating posts, we should include the below code to the index.php file because it is the file that is used to display the content of our theme.
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1698324350741_0.png)
		- There are 2 loops in this code, the first loop which is an if condition will check the availability of posts and the second loop which is a while loop prints the posts until there are no posts left to print.
		- The **<?php the_title(); ?>** which is a pre-built function identifies the title of the post and then prints it. same goes for the content tag.
		- We have used styles to style the title and the paragraph by closing the php tags and opening them in necessary places.
	- Even though we have added the codes to add the posts to our theme, if we navigate through our menu section and come back to the home page you would see that the posts would be gone. that's because WordPress default setting is to display the latest posts in our home page. to change this;
		- Click on settings
		- Click on Reading
		- Under your homepage displays, click  A static page
		- Under Homepage select the page that you want as the home page.
		- Create a separate page to include your blog posts and then navigate to the same location and select the page name where you want your posts to be displayed under Posts page.
		- After that go to Menus under appearance and add the blog page that you created to the menu structure.
		- Now you could see the posts that you created under the blog tab
	- If we inspect elements and navigate through our navigation menu, you could see that nothing changes in the elements because it won't identify the changes. because of this it will be hard to add changes to the theme using separate plugins or in a different theme editor. to prevent that;
		- Open the header.php file and add the below code inside the body tag.
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1698326803104_0.png)
		- now if you inspect elements, WordPress will be able to identify the changes of the classes that you're navigating to.
	- If you want to print a custom class in the body, you should do as follow by adding an array inside the php body_class and specifying which class you want to add;
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1698468342276_0.png)
	- The above method will print the given class in every page. to print a specific class in a specific page we should first instruct WordPress to identify the current page where the user is. to do that;
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1698469945205_0.png)
		- this code lines will check whether you are in the home page or not.
		- If we click on the home page tab and inspect elements, you would see that the class will be **no-awesome-class**.
		- This is because WordPress, by default it will consider the page which consists the blogs as the home page.
		- To check whether we are in the front page we could use the **is_front_page()** function instead of the **is_home()** function.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1698470139729_0.png)
- # Lesson 05: Creating custom & specialized Page Templates
	- To create a page derived from the normal styling, you should create a separate php file and then edit it as you need.
	- Always remember to add the **get_header** and **get_footer** functions when creating a new php file for a new page.
	- But with this method we can't predict the names and create new pages each and every time when a user want to create a page. because of that reason we create a page template.
	- To inform WordPress that the specific php file is a page template, we should add the template name inside the php tag as follows;
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1698477217878_0.png)
		- To select the template we could navigate to the WordPress dashboard, under pages select the page you want and then you could see a tab to select the page template.
		- By default WordPress have selected the default template which is the index.php file.
	- If the user decides to change the premalink of a page, the user cannot see view the page again because the new name is not the existing name of the php file. rather than changing the php file name we could assign the page id as the page name which never changes. this will prevent this issue.
		- To get the id of the page, go to the administration panel (Wp Dashboard), click on the page you want and then click on the URL and see the variable assigned to POST. that is the id of the page.
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1698491411603_0.png)
		- After that change the php file name to **page-8**.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1698491646540_0.png)

- # Lesson 06: Adding theme features with add_theme_support
	- Theme support is important built-in functionality which is used add many features to the theme.
	- If we are using  a separate php file for functions we don't need to add the add_theme_support hook inside a function. it can be added outside the functions. but if we are using this hook in plugin development, we should add this hook inside a function and then call it using add action.
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1698494200514_0.png)
	- If we use the **custom-header** and add a header image to the website, it won't be displayed. to prevent this we should instruct WordPress to display it. other styles will be displayed because WordPress will generate the inline styles for those styles but for the header image it can't generate because it's a bit complex. therefore we should provide the code.
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1698494846989_0.png)
	- Add the above code line in the header.php file because we want this image to be displayed in the header.
	- To get detailed information of a hook, type **var_dump(hook name)** inside a php tag. this will display all the information that hook stores.
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1698495017488_0.png)
	- ## post_thumbnails
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1698495403143_0.png)
		- To display the image we should include the necessary code lines in the index.php file.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1698495491506_0.png)
			- We could use **large** for the post_thumbnail which will make the image large.

- # Lesson 07: Adding & creating post formats.
	- There are 9 methods to format a post in a website. they are;
		- **aside**
		- **gallery**
		- **link**
		- **image**
		- **quote**
		- **status**
		- **video**
		- **audio**
		- **chat**
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1698555185304_0.png)
	- To see the current format of the post,
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1698555369322_0.png)
	- We could use post formats to include different files to our post based on the post format. to do that , we could use the **get_template_part()** function.
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1698555896173_0.png)
		- I have removed the code lines which were used to display the content of page and added those code lines in file called content.php and called that file inside the **get_template_part()** function. this is how this function is used to add seperate files to our page.
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1698556817159_0.png)
		- In here I have instructed to display the posts based on their formats. In the WordPress dashboard we can select the order of the post which should be displayed. according to that and the file names I have given, it will select the necessary post to display. in here it will first search for the file name 'content' and then search for the post format name. I have created files with the post format names. we could use any name instead of content. (post-image, post-aside)
			- content-aside
			- content-image
