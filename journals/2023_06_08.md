- # Computer Memory [[Computer Memory]]
	- ## Virtual Memory
		- It is a storage mechanism which offers users an illusion of having a large main memory.
		- It is done by allocating a part of the secondary memory as the main memory
		- It is comparatively slower than the main memory
		- Virtual memory can be implemented via:
			- ### **Demand Paging**
				- It is the process of keeping infrequently used pages in the secondary memory until  it is demanded/ requested.
				- It is also known as **Lazy Swapping**
				- Benifits;
					- Less I/O needed
					- Less memory needed
					- Faster response
					- Support more processes
				- ### **Page Fault Trap**
					- It occurs when the required page is not in the main memory but in the virtual memory
						- i/0 => Not available in the main memroy
						- v/1 => Available in the main memory
					- When page fault occurs the process to avoid it will be;
						- Locate empty frame
						- Initiate disk I/O
						- Move Page to the empty frame from the disk
						- Update page table to 1/v
					- #### What if we are unable to find a free frame?
						- In this case Page Replacement will be done
						- Page replacement is the process where that a page will be swapped out to get a free frame to swap in the required page.
						- **Basic Replacement Process**
							- 1) Find the location of the required page
							- 2)
						- **Types of page replacement methods**
							- Fist in First Out (FIFO) Algorithm
								- It is the process where the oldest page will be executed to make space for a free frame.
							- Optimal Page Replacement
			- ### **Demand Segmentation**
